BASELINE UNIGRAM FEATURE EXTRACTION
===================================

Use the ngram-feature module's word ngram feature
extraction script with NVAL=1 to do word unigram
feature extraction. This script is located at:

yelp_review / feature_extract / ngram_feature / extract_word_ngram_features.py 

This is used as one of the baselines for comparing the performance of
stylometric features.
