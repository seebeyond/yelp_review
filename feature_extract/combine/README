COMBINE FEATURES SCRIPT
=======================

This script can be used to combine all individual features from
basic_features, pcfg_feature, ngram_feature and sentiment_feature.

Till a pipeline is in place, this setup can be used.

Very volatile code since it needs to change based on other feature
extraction components. Better to double check this component every time
any change is done to feature extraction component.
