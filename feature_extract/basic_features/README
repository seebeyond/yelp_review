BASIC FEATURES extraction
=========================


Extracts basic features from the review Yelp data which
are not related to review text language as such.
Examples of such features include, rating associated with 
the review, age of review, reviewer information and other
such info associated with each review instance in Yelp data.

The script in this module extracts these features from
preprocessed reviews and puts them into a CSV file that can
be used for combining with other features.
