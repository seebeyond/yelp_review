Ngram feature extraction
========================

    
    Added two scripts for extracting character and word ngram features.
    Has some compatability issue since python has some issues with smoothing.
    This is tested in:
    
    >>> nltk.__version__
    '2.0.4'
    
    * While testing few word ngrams and character ngrams had probabilities
    greater than 1 (which is the smoothing prob)
    * As an adhoc fix to unblock, this code ignores such ngrams. They accounted for
    13-14% of the total (repetitions included) ngrams in the data. This analysis code can be found at the bottom of the files (commented).
    * Word ngram script works for N-value 1,2 and 3 only ie., bi and trigram features.
    
    The script creates ngram model and also generates ngram features for training
    data simulataneously in a single step. So, if models need to be stored seperately, the code needs to be changed to pickle the model and reus
    
    For arguments, please check comments inside the script.
