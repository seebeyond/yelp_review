FEATURE EXTRACTION
==================

This module contains scripts and code for
extraction of different features namely:
1)PCFG features
2)Ngram features
3)Sentiment features
4) baseline features
5) basic features

It also includes a 'combine' module that helps
combine all these seperately extracted features
into one feature input file for modeling. This is
slightly hard coded nature and code should be studied
to modify according to needs.

Also, see description inside different feature extraction
components to know dependencies.
